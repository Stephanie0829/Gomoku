### Other details
- Pieces and home screen image created using figma (c)
- Used a connect four tutorial as inspiriation during the learning/brainstorming process. Linked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8392NJjj8s0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
- Future thoughts/improvements:mini
  - Use neural networks (reinforcement learning) to improve the speed and accuracy of algorithm (minimax is limited by computer power)
  - Add a database for keeping the highest user score and other data
  - Create an easier access such as making it web based or deployed on a hosting site
